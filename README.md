# 🦀 Learning Rust

> Systems programming. Memory safety. Zero-cost abstractions.

This repository documents my journey learning Rust from scratch — focusing on systems thinking, ownership, and data structures.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand Rust ownership & borrowing deeply  
- Write safe systems-level code  
- Implement DSA problems in Rust  
- Transition from C/C++ mindset to Rust mindset  
- Build towards real-world projects (backend, embedded, performance systems)

---

## 📚 What I’m Covering

### 🟢 Basics
- Variables & mutability  
- Data types  
- Arrays  
- Loops  
- Functions  
- Vectors  

### 🧠 Core Rust Concepts
- Ownership  
- Borrowing  
- Lifetimes  
- Moves vs Copy  
- Stack vs Heap  

### ⚙️ Data Structures & Algorithms
- Two Sum (brute force → hashmap)  
- Sorting algorithms  
- Recursion  
- HashMap usage  
- Pattern matching  

## 🚀 Why Rust?

- Memory safety without garbage collection  
- Compile-time guarantees  
- Concurrency without data races  
- Modern tooling  
- Performance comparable to C++
