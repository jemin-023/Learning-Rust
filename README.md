# 🦀 Learning Rust

> Systems programming. Memory safety. Zero-cost abstractions.

This repository documents my journey learning Rust from scratch — focusing on systems thinking, ownership, and data structures.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand Rust ownership & borrowing deeply  
- Write safe systems-level code  
- Implement DSA problems in Rust  
- Transition from C/C++ mindset to Rust mindset  
- Build towards real-world projects (backend, embedded, performance systems)

## 📚 What I’m Covering

### 🟢 Basics
- [x] Variables & mutability  
- [x] Data types  
- [x] Arrays, Strings, Slice 
- [x] Loops  
- [x] Functions  
- [ ] Vectors  

### 🧠 Core Rust Concepts
- [x] Ownership  
- [x] Borrowing  
- [ ] Lifetimes  
- [ ] Moves vs Copy  
- [ ] Stack vs Heap  
- [ ] Smart Pointers

## 🚀 Why Rust?

- Memory safety without garbage collection  
- Compile-time guarantees  
- Concurrency without data races  
- Modern tooling  
- Performance comparable to C++
